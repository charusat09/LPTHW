# Notes:
# When I try to make this script shorter I get an error when I close the
# files at the end. You probably did something like this, indata =
# open(from_file).read(), which means you donâ€™t need to then do
# in_file.close() when you reach the end of the script. It should already be
# closed by Python once that one line runs.
